# Bayes-Classifier-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection
The goal of this project is to detect cancer detection by using gaussian bayes classifier. 

## Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier From Scratch
In `Bayesian` probability terminology we have:
$$posterior = \dfrac{prior \times likelihood}{evidence}$$
Naïve Bayes is a classification algorithm (probabilistic classifier) with naïve assumption that features are conditional independent of each other.
